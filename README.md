Swedish Academy Dictionary wget script

This script fetches the entire dictionary, or more correctly, wordlist from the 
Swedish Academy's website and saves it to the current directory. 

The wordlist is provided on the web as .jpg images, and when running
this script each of these .jpg:s are downloaded.  The output from eceuiform  is really ugly, you should be warned.
